# Property Investment Calculator

This website is a free property investment calculator used to analyse the possible outcome of a property purchase.

It was created by Max Mumford at [Cocept.io](http://www.Cocept.io) as a free tool for property investers to use to help them make financial decisions.

# Boring but mandatory disclaimer

This tool only provides estimated figures based on what the user types in - it in no way constitutes financial advice and should not be used as anything other than a useful thingymajig. Neither Max Mumford nor Cocept take any responsibility for the user's investment or any decisions taken based on it's calculations; for it is but a humble collection of 1's and 0's.
